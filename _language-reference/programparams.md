# Program parameters

## Syntax

```
ProgramParams = (' [ Identifier { ',' Identifier } ] ')' ;
```

## Description

The program parameters are specified by comma separated
list of [identifiers](identifier).

Although they are parsed, they currently have no
further function and are simply ignored.
